# SpotsDialog.Xamarin
This is a Xamarin Binding Library project that I created in order to use Spots.Dialog within my Xamarin.Android applications and replace the Progress Dialog.
	  
Current Version of FlexBoxLayout is 0.7

https://github.com/d-max/spots-dialog

Original Description:
Android AlertDialog with moving spots progress indicator packed as android library. Example:

`
AlertDialog dialog = new SpotsDialog(context);

dialog.Show();

//...

dialog.Dismiss();
`

You can install the package from Nuget:

**PM> Install-Package SpotsDialog.Xamarin -Version 0.7.0**

The original library was developed by:
