# SpotsDialog.Xamarin
This is a Xamarin Binding Library project that I created in order to use Spots.Dialog within my Xamarin.Android applications and replace the Progress Dialog.

Original Description:
Android AlertDialog with moving spots progress indicator packed as android library. Example:
AlertDialog dialog = new SpotsDialog(context);
dialog.Show();
//...
dialog.Dismiss();
	  
Current Version of FlexBoxLayout is 0.7
